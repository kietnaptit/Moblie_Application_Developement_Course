# Android Exercise 4

In this Exercise. We will learn how to build a Simple Calculator app using TextView and Button in Kotlin

## Requirement

* Simple Version: User input an operand then pick an operator then enter the second operand then click equal button, the result will display on screen. User might click another operator to continue calculate with the saved result

* Advanced Version: User can input a full formula that includes many operand and operator. When click equal button, the system will display the final result. The priority in calculate is applied (For example, Multiple and Division has priority higher than plus and minus)
